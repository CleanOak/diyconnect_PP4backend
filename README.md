# **Planning**

## **User Stories**

A user story was created solely for the backend to ensure focus and consistency. You can view the user stories on [this project board](https://github.com/users/CleanOak/projects/5).


## **Data Models**

Various data models were drawn out before creating the actual models, to serve as a blueprint for database design, helping with concepts and organisation of the structure of a database.

| **MODEL**                    |          **KEY**            |    **NAME**              |   **TYPE**                                 |
| -----------------------------| --------------------------- | -------------------------|------------------------------------------- |
| **USER**                     |          PrimaryKey         |      id                  |    Integer                                 |
|                              |                             |         username         |                                            |
|                              |                             |  password                |                                            |
|                              |                             |                          |                                            |

## **Relationships**

### User Profile:
- User (OneToOne): Each user has a user profile, establishing a OneToOne relationship. This ensures that each user has a single profile, and vice versa.

### Posts:
- User (OneToMany): Each post is created and uploaded by a user. This relationship indicates a OneToMany relationship, where one user can create multiple posts, but each post is associated with only one user.
- Category (ManyToOne): Each post can belong to a category (optional). This relationship indicates a ManyToOne relationship, where multiple posts can belong to the same category, but each post is linked to one category.

### Comments:
- Recipe Post (OneToMany): Comments are associated with posts, following a OneToMany relationship. Each post can have multiple comments, but each comment is linked to only one post.
- User (OneToMany): Similarly, comments are posted by users, forming another OneToMany relationship. A user can write multiple comments, but each comment is linked to only one user.

### Likes:
- Post (OneToMany): Likes are associated with posts, following a OneToMany relationship. Each post can have multiple likes, but each like is linked to only one post.
- User (OneToMany): Similarly, likes are made by users, forming another OneToMany relationship. A user can like multiple posts, but each like is attributed to only one user.

### Followers:
- User (ManyToMany): Followers represent a ManyToMany relationship with users. A user can follow many users, and each user can be followed by many users.

### Bookmark
- User (OneToMany): bookmarks are made by users, forming another OneToMany relationship. A user can bookmark multiple posts, but each bookmark is attributed to only one user.
- Post (OneToMany): Bookmarks are associated with posts, following a OneToMany relationship. Each post can have multiple bookmarks, but each bookmark is linked to only one post.

# **Website Security**

## env.py File
- API keys and databases are stored in the env.py which is not included in version control to prevent exposure.

# **Features/Apps**

To explain the features of the API, it is easier to break them down by Apps. A short explanation of each app is detailed below.

## **Profiles**

When a user registers on the app, a Profile is automatically created for them. This can then be updated by the user should they wish.

**API Endpoints:**
- **/profiles/**: to list (GET) profiles.
- **/profiles/:id/**: to show (GET) or update (PUT) a profile.

## **Environment & Settings**

- In your IDE open your env.py file or create one in the main directory if it hasn't been created for you.
- Having created your cloud-based database, add the DATABASE_URL value and a SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
- Open the settings.py file and import the env.py file and the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY file paths.
- Install Django and add to requirements.txt.
- Create your project.
- Add the STATIC files settings.
- Create a file called Procfile (with a capital P) in the main directory,
- For cloud-based image storage, add Cloudinary URL to env.py
- Add Cloudinary libraries to INSTALLED APPS.
- Add your IDE workspace and Heroku to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
- Make migrations and migrate.
- Create new Django project - *django-admin startproject <home_api>*.
- Create Superuser (email can be left blank) - *python manage.py createsuperuser (username>email>password1>password2)*.
- Create your apps - *python manage.py startapp <nameofapp>*.
- Before you add, commit & push your files to GitHub, ensure DEBUG is set to False in your settings.py file.

## **Deploying to Heroku**

- Log in or create an account on Heroku.com. Click 'New' and then 'Create New App'.
- Give your project a unique name and select a region, then click 'Create App'.
- Connect your Heroku project to your GitHub repository. Under deployment you can choose GitHub, find the relevant one and click 'Connect'.
- Once connected, go to the Settings tab and click on 'Reveal Config Vars'. Add the following:
  - CLOUDINARY_URL - copied URL from Cloudinary
  - DATABASE_URL - copied URL from PostgreSQL
  - SECRET_KEY - a unique secret key
  - ALLOWED_HOST - with the value of your deployed Heroku application URL
  - DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC - add 1 if this is to be disabled to prevent errors, or 0 if the app is in a state where errors will not be generated.
- Navigate to the Deploy section, click on Github for the deployment method and confirm.
- Search for your repository name and click connect.
- At the bottom of the deploy section, make sure you are connected to the main branch and then click Deploy Branch.
- You can then view your live site.
